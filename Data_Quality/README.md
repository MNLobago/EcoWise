# Data Quality Assessment and Clustering Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks aimed at assessing the quality of data used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The first notebook focuses on fine-tuning a BERT model and analyzing the resulting data quality, while the second notebook employs clustering techniques on textual data to uncover patterns and similarities.

## Fine-Tuning Data Quality Assessment

This notebook analyzes and evaluates fine-tuning data quality based on the results from fine-tuning a Question Answering (QA) system using a BERT model. The primary objective is to assess how well the fine-tuned model performs and the quality of the training data.

### Introduction

In NLP, the quality of fine-tuning data significantly impacts model performance. This notebook assesses the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process by analyzing training loss and validation loss metrics across epochs.

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `transformers`
  - `datasets`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets pandas matplotlib numpy
```

### Script Overview

The primary script used for fine-tuning is `bert_finetune2.py`. It loads the dataset, initializes the BERT model, and conducts the fine-tuning process on the training dataset.

### Running the Notebook

To run the notebook:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Anaconda).
3. Update the paths in the notebook to point to your fine-tuning dataset CSV file.
4. Execute each cell to fine-tune the model using `bert_finetune2.py` and visualize the results.

### Interpreting the Results

The following table summarizes the loss values recorded during each epoch:

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| 1     | No log       | 4.215715         |
| 2     | No log       | 3.396696         |
| 3     | No log       | 2.884476         |
| 4     | No log       | 2.290786         |
| 5     | No log       | 1.844388         |
| 6     | No log       | 1.567895         |
| 7     | No log       | 1.387054         |
| 8     | No log       | 1.251402         |
| 9     | No log       | 1.179281         |
| 10    | No log       | 1.158551         |

- **Trends**: A general decrease in training and validation losses over epochs indicates effective learning from the data.
- **Final Analysis**: The validation loss stabilizes around 1.158551 at the tenth epoch, suggesting successful fine-tuning.

### Conclusion

The fine-tuning process using `bert_finetune2.py` reveals effective learning from the training data. The decline in validation loss indicates that the fine-tuning dataset is likely well-structured and representative of the tasks the model will perform.

## Clustering Analysis of Text Data

This project involves clustering textual data using the KMeans clustering algorithm and TF-IDF vectorization. The goal is to identify optimal clusters within the text data to explore underlying patterns and similarities.

### Overview

The project assesses the potential for clustering within the textual dataset, enabling deeper insights into the structure and relationships among the data points.

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `NumPy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Dataset

The dataset is included in a CSV file named `format2.csv`. It should contain at least two columns: 
- `context`: The text to be clustered.
- `question`: Additional associated text that is not utilized in clustering but is required for preprocessing.

### Getting Started

1. **Load the Dataset**: 
   The notebook reads data from `format2.csv`, preprocessing it by removing rows with missing values for `context` or `question`.

2. **Text Vectorization**:
   The context data is transformed into numerical format using the TF-IDF vectorizer, generating a matrix of TF-IDF features.

3. **KMeans Clustering**:
   The notebook performs KMeans clustering on the vectorized text, varying the number of clusters from 4 to 9 and calculating the sum of squared distances to help determine the optimal cluster count.

4. **Visualization**:
   Results are visualized using Matplotlib, displaying the Sum of Squared Distances against the number of clusters.

### Usage

To run the notebook, open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially.

### Functionality

The notebook includes the following functionalities:
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values.
- TF-IDF vectorization of text data.
- KMeans clustering with dynamic cluster size.
- Visualization of clustering performance.

### Example Output

Upon running the notebook, a plot will display the Sum of Squared Distances versus the number of clusters, assisting in identifying the optimal cluster count.

### Findings

During the analysis, the elbow method indicated an optimal number of clusters at 7. This elbow point signifies where adding more clusters yields diminishing returns in clustering performance, thus suggesting that 7 clusters may effectively capture the underlying patterns in the data.
