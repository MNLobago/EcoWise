Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, release carbon dioxide when burned, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Alternative energies like wind and solar power have a much lower carbon footprint as they do not release greenhouse gasses during operation. Respiration and growth, as well as photosynthesis by plants, are natural processes that do not directly contribute to an individual's carbon footprint.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"question = \"\"\"\n The main human activity adds to an individual's carbon footprint.? \n1)Sometimes its hard to find shoes that are the right size, \n2)If we don't decrease greenhouse gas emissions Earth will continue to cool, \n3)Greenhouse gases are becoming scarce in Earth's atmosphere,\n4)Increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are contributing to global climate change.\n\"\"\"\ngemma_qa.query(question)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-04T14:35:53.251378Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-04T14:35:53.251817Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-04T14:36:36.332521Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-04T14:35:53.251774Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-04T14:36:36.329199Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Question:\n\n The main human activity adds to an individual's carbon footprint.? \n1)Sometimes its hard to find shoes that are the right size, \n2)If we don't decrease greenhouse gas emissions Earth will continue to cool, \n3)Greenhouse gases are becoming scarce in Earth's atmosphere,\n4)Increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are contributing to global climate change.\n\n\n**<font color='green'>Answer:</font>**\n1.
