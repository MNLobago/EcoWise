Answer

Focusing on carbon leaves out all the highly potent greenhouse gases without carbon. See IPCC AR6 WG1 Tables 7.15 and AIII.4f.

Consequently, rather than carbon footprint, instead ecological footprint:

Answer

There is no doubt that AI affects emissions. Here is a short article presenting some figures: [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity/](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scientificamerican.com%2Farticle%2Fthe-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity%2F).

However, there are positives. As the demand for AI increases, more AI-assisted applications to improve energy efficiency and address various sustainability are also appearing. This could be one way of offsetting its carbon footprint.

Also, In my view, one of the most important, yet overlooked, aspects of Generative AI in terms of sustainability is the impact of its discourses and narratives on the environment.

In this question you have posted, for instance, we can see replies that are clearly AI-generated, and they fail to acknowledge the potential of Generative AI to make societal narratives more sustainable.

[Are so-called carbon credits an effective instrument for real reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere?](post/Are_so-called_carbon_credits_an_effective_instrument_for_real_reduction_of_CO2_emissions_into_the_atmosphere)

Question

24 answers

- 9 Aug 2023

**In your opinion, are so-called "carbon credits" consisting of some corporation taking a specific patch of natural forest cover, including, for example, a patch of natural Amazon Rainforest, for an additional ton of CO2 emissions, an effective instrument for real reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere?**

To consider the question of the role of so-called "carbon credits" in the context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, one would have to assume that such a system actually reliably works. However, from what is reported by independent journalists, environmentalists, people who care about protecting the climate, biosphere and biodiversity of the planet's natural ecosystems, including the forests of the Amazon, even those declared patches of natural Amazon Rainforest taken for protection under the so-called carbon credits are nevertheless often cut down.

Perhaps something will finally begin to change, to improve, in terms of protecting the climate, biosphere and biodiversity of the natural ecosystems of the Amazon Rainforest in connection with the first Amazon Forest Conservation Summit in 14 years, currently being held in Belém, Brazil. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 60 percent in July compared to the same month last year. The announcement of the positive trend coincides with the start of a summit in Belém of the 8 countries whose territories include the Amazon forest. This summit is attended by representatives of the governments of the 8 countries whose territory includes the natural Amazon Forest. Perhaps plans and commitments will be made to realistically protect this largest terrestrial reservoir of natural biodiversity and natural forests characterized by a particularly high contribution to absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and producing oxygen. It may also be that the processes of increasing the scale of protection of these forests and reducing their still large-scale logging will be accelerated so that by 2030 at the latest, the deforestation of these forests will be completely ended. This is a particularly important issue because more than 20 percent of the Amazon rainforest has already disappeared due to human activity.

In view of the above, I address the following question to the esteemed community of scientists and researchers:

_In your opinion, are the so-called carbon credits, which consist in the fact that some corporation, for an additional ton of CO2 emissions, will take under protection a certain patch of natural forest cover, including, for example, a patch of natural Amazon Rainforest, an effective instrument for real reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere?_

_Are so-called carbon credits an effective instrument to realistically reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere?_

The description of **Complex Multivariable Dynamic Systems using Two-by-Two (or more) Isolate Parameters' Correlations** can only be **Incomplete**; so that it can't produce irrefutable scientific assertions. In this regard, The well-known (1535 citations) old paper **\[1\]** by Trenberth (1990) shows that climate analyses **can be compromised** by measurement, data coverage, or analysis uncertainties. **One may read within the text** " _...Most presentations of climate change focus on the surface variables of importance to man, in particular temperature and precipitation. But in order to understand why the changes occur the way they do, it is essential to consider the atmospheric dynamics, as well as the local physical processes operating to induce change. The atmospheric circulation forms the main link between regional changes in wind, temperature, precipitation, and other climatic variables, and there is likely to be a reasonably strong relationship between these even on monthly or longer time scales. Physical and dynamical consistency between changes of several climate variables can add confidence to results_ **_for a single variable_** _which might otherwise_ **_be compromised by measurement, data coverage, or analysis uncertainties_** _..._"

Currently, it is a great need to increase yields with the same production area in the world, therefore it is important to carry out agriculture that is sustainable, without lowering yields and without causing damage to the ecology (soil, water, atmosphere) and Of course, it doesn't harm living beings either. For this, it is important to link the farmer, the government and the scientific community to implement and evaluate all tools and standards of practices in agricultural production, and their continuous observation and monitoring in order to achieve sustainability over time.

Lets begin with understanding money as liquid, which is how CHINESE describes MONEY as WATER.

**MONEY as WATER & LIQUIDITY**

The expression "money is like water" is often attributed to Chinese culture, and it reflects a particular mindset about wealth and its fluid nature. While not everyone in China may use this expression, it does capture a common attitude towards money. Here are some reasons why money is sometimes metaphorically equated with water in Chinese culture:

1. **Fluidity and Circulation:** Water is fluid and can flow easily. Similarly, the idea is that money should not be stagnant but should circulate and flow smoothly through various channels of the economy. This concept emphasizes the importance of keeping money in motion to generate economic activity.

2. **Adaptability:** Water can take the shape of its container and adapt to different forms. Money, too, is seen as something that should be adaptable and flexible. The ability to adapt to different financial situations is valued, and the metaphor highlights the importance of being nimble in financial matters.

3. **Renewal and Growth:** Water is essential for the growth of plants and sustaining life. Money, in a similar sense, is considered crucial for economic growth and development. The metaphor emphasizes the idea that money, like water, is essential for sustaining and fostering prosperity.

4. **Symbol of Abundance:** In Chinese culture, water is often associated with abundance and prosperity. The metaphor of money being like water might convey the idea that there is an abundance of financial opportunities and resources available, and one should tap into them wisely.

5. **Flowing Fortunes:** The phrase could also imply that fortunes, like water, are ever-changing. What may be plentiful today might be scarce tomorrow, emphasizing the importance of being mindful of financial fluctuations and making sound financial decisions.


**CO2 as LIQUIDITY**

If we conceptualize CO2 as liquidity rather than a gas or vapor, we are essentially considering carbon dioxide as a form of tradable liquid asset that represents environmental impact. This approach adds an additional layer to the integration of CO2 into a financial system. Here's how this could be incorporated into the concept:

01. **CO2 Liquidity Units:** Instead of carbon credits, introduce the concept of CO2 liquidity units. These units would represent a standardized measure of carbon emissions that can be bought, sold, or traded in the market.

02. **Liquid Carbon Market:** Establish a liquid carbon market where entities, including businesses, governments, and individuals, can buy and sell CO2 liquidity units. This market would function similarly to financial markets where liquidity is traded.

03. **Carbon Liquidity Exchanges:** Create specialized carbon liquidity exchanges where participants can engage in the buying and selling of CO2 liquidity units. These exchanges would operate alongside traditional financial exchanges.

04. **Liquidity Providers:** Designate entities, such as environmental organizations or sustainable initiatives, as liquidity providers. These entities would contribute to the market by removing excess CO2 liquidity units from circulation through activities like carbon sequestration or environmental projects.

05. **Centralized Liquidity Authority:** Establish a centralized authority responsible for regulating and overseeing the CO2 liquidity market. This authority would manage the overall liquidity supply, adjusting it based on environmental goals and targets.

06. **Carbon-backed Liquidity Reserves:** Implement carbon-backed liquidity reserves to stabilize the value of CO2 liquidity units. These reserves would function similarly to central bank reserves in traditional financial systems.

07. **Carbon Liquidity-backed Financial Instruments:** Develop financial instruments, such as bonds or loans, that are backed by CO2 liquidity units. This would provide a way for financial markets to support sustainable projects, similar to green bonds.

08. **Liquidity-based Incentives:** Introduce incentives for entities to maintain or increase their liquidity levels. Those who reduce their carbon emissions and maintain a surplus of CO2 liquidity units could benefit financially, while those with deficits would face higher costs.

09. **Real-time Liquidity Monitoring:** Implement advanced monitoring systems for real-time tracking of carbon liquidity levels. This transparency would enable better decision-making and responsiveness to changes in environmental conditions.

10. **Education and Adoption:** Promote education and awareness about the CO2 liquidity system to ensure widespread understanding and adoption. Stakeholders, including businesses and individuals, need to grasp the concept of CO2 as a form of liquid asset.


This conceptualization aims to integrate the idea of liquidity into the carbon economy, treating CO2 as a tradable liquid asset with a value that can be influenced by market forces. It introduces the dynamics of supply, demand, and liquidity management into the broader context of environmental sustainability. As with any innovative financial system, careful planning, regulation, and adaptation are crucial for its successful implementation. Additionally, it's essential to consider potential unintended consequences and continually assess the system's effectiveness in achieving environmental goals.

**MONEY & CURRENCIES PEGGED to CO2 as LIQUID SUPPLY & DEMAND**

Here's a conceptual approach to a real-world system where money is pegged to CO2 supply and demand:

01. **Carbon Credits as Tradable Assets:** Implement a system where carbon credits become tradable assets, similar to stocks or bonds in financial markets. These carbon credits would represent the right to emit a certain amount of CO2.

02. **Carbon Pricing Mechanism:** Introduce a carbon pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. This places a cost on carbon emissions, creating a direct economic incentive for businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint.

03. **Centralized Carbon Authority:** Establish a centralized carbon authority responsible for issuing and regulating carbon credits. This authority would control the overall supply of carbon credits in circulation, adjusting it based on environmental goals and targets.

04. **Currency Pegged to Carbon Credits:** Create a new form of currency that is directly pegged to the supply of carbon credits. The value of this currency would be tied to the overall carbon emissions allowed within a specified period.

05. **Carbon Reserve System:** Implement a carbon reserve system, similar to a central bank's reserve system, to manage fluctuations in carbon credit supply and demand. The reserve would be used to stabilize the value of the carbon-backed currency.

06. **Incentives for Carbon Reduction:** Offer financial incentives for businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon emissions. Those who emit less than their allocated carbon credits could sell their excess credits, while those exceeding their limit would need to buy additional credits.

07. **International Carbon Exchange:** Facilitate an international carbon exchange where countries can trade carbon credits, fostering global cooperation in addressing climate change. This exchange would allow nations to balance their emissions by buying and selling credits on the international market.

08. **Carbon-backed Financial Instruments:** Develop financial instruments such as bonds or loans that are backed by carbon credits. This could encourage investments in sustainable projects and provide a way for financial markets to support environmentally friendly initiatives.

09. **Carbon Auditing and Verification:** Implement rigorous carbon auditing and verification processes to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of carbon credit transactions. This would prevent fraud and maintain the integrity of the carbon-backed currency.

10. **Transition Period and Education:** Recognize that transitioning to a carbon-backed currency would require careful planning and education. Governments, businesses, and the public would need to understand the new system and its implications.


It's important to note that while this concept provides a real-world approach, it is highly complex and would face numerous challenges, including international cooperation, regulatory frameworks, and the need for a robust infrastructure to manage the carbon credit system.

**The CARBON COIN/ DOLLAR**

Pegging an international currency to a conception of CO2 reduction involves linking the value of the currency to the success and progress of global efforts in reducing carbon emissions. Here's a conceptual framework for how this might be achieved:

01. **Creation of a Carbon-Backed International Currency:** Develop a new international currency, let's call it "CarbonCoin" for illustration purposes, directly pegged to the global reduction of carbon emissions. The value of CarbonCoin would be tied to the success in achieving predetermined global CO2 reduction targets.

02. **Global Carbon Reduction Targets:** Establish ambitious and scientifically informed global carbon reduction targets. These targets would serve as the benchmark against which the value of CarbonCoin is pegged. The more successful the world is in meeting these targets, the stronger the value of CarbonCoin.

03. **Carbon Reduction Verification Mechanism:** Implement a robust and transparent global mechanism for verifying carbon reduction efforts. This could involve international organizations, technological solutions, and agreements that ensure accurate reporting and accountability for CO2 reductions.

04. **CarbonCoin Reserve System:** Create a global CarbonCoin reserve system that stores CarbonCoins in proportion to the cumulative global CO2 reductions achieved. This reserve would act as a backing for the international currency, similar to gold backing traditional currencies in the past.

05. **International CarbonCoin Authority:** Establish an international authority responsible for managing the CarbonCoin system. This authority would oversee the pegging process, verify carbon reductions, and adjust the supply of CarbonCoins in circulation based on global progress toward emission reduction goals.

06. **CarbonCoin Exchange Mechanism:** Develop a global exchange mechanism for CarbonCoins, where countries and entities can buy, sell, and trade CarbonCoins based on their individual and collective contributions to CO2 reduction. This exchange would influence the value of CarbonCoin in the international market.

07. **CarbonCoin as a Reserve Currency:** Promote the use of CarbonCoin as a reserve currency alongside traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro. Countries could hold CarbonCoins in their reserves as a way to demonstrate and support their commitment to environmental sustainability.

08. **Incentives for Carbon Reduction:** Offer financial incentives for countries and entities that contribute significantly to global CO2 reductions. This could involve rewarding nations with additional CarbonCoins based on their achievements in emission reduction.

09. **CarbonCoin-Backed Bonds and Financial Instruments:** Introduce financial instruments, such as bonds, loans, or investment products, that are backed by CarbonCoins. This would create a market for sustainable investments and encourage the allocation of funds to projects contributing to CO2 reduction.

10. **International Cooperation and Agreements:** Encourage international cooperation through agreements and treaties that support the CarbonCoin system. Cooperation would be vital to the success of this currency peg, requiring commitments from nations to pursue and maintain effective carbon reduction policies.


Implementing such a system would require significant coordination, cooperation, and commitment from the international community. It would also involve addressing challenges such as varying levels of economic development, differing national priorities, and potential resistance to adopting a new international currency system. Additionally, technological advancements in monitoring and verification of carbon reduction efforts would play a crucial role in the success of this conceptual framework.

**How Pegging CO2 as LIQUIDITIES to CURRENCY EXCHANGES can OVERCOME EXISTING INERTIA to CO2 REDUCTION**

Pegging CO2 as liquidities to currency exchanges could potentially introduce innovative financial mechanisms to overcome hurdles in CO2 reduction efforts. Here are ways in which this approach might help address challenges:

**Market-Driven Incentives:**

**How it Helps:** By pegging CO2 as liquidities to currency exchanges, you create a market for trading carbon assets. This introduces market-driven incentives for businesses and nations to reduce emissions, as they can profit from selling excess carbon liquidities or face costs for exceeding their allocated limits.

**Flexibility and Adaptability:**

**How it Helps:** Liquid markets are often more flexible. This flexibility can be harnessed to adapt to varying circumstances, allowing entities to buy or sell carbon liquidities based on changing economic conditions or technological advancements. It provides a dynamic system that can adjust to evolving emission reduction challenges.

**Global Collaboration through Trading:**

**How it Helps:** A liquid carbon market could facilitate global collaboration. Countries with a surplus of carbon liquidities can trade with those facing challenges, promoting a more efficient allocation of resources for emissions reduction. This approach encourages a collaborative, international effort to achieve overall reduction targets.

**Liquidity-Backed Investments:**

**How it Helps:** The concept of CO2 liquidities as a tradable asset could attract investments in sustainable and low-carbon projects. Financial instruments backed by carbon liquidities, such as bonds or green funds, may become attractive to investors, funneling capital into initiatives that contribute to emission reduction.

**Transparent Market Mechanism:**

**How it Helps:** Liquid markets often operate with a high degree of transparency. This transparency could help overcome challenges related to verification and trust. It ensures that the buying and selling of carbon liquidities are conducted with integrity, minimizing the risk of fraudulent activities.

**Carbon Liquidity Reserves:**

**How it Helps:** Establishing reserves of carbon liquidities can act as a stabilizing mechanism. During economic downturns or unexpected challenges, entities can tap into these reserves to meet emission reduction targets without facing excessive financial burdens, promoting long-term stability in carbon markets.

**Economic Growth with Emission Reduction:How it Helps:** Liquid carbon markets could provide a mechanism for balancing economic growth with emission reduction. As economies grow, they may need additional carbon liquidities, which can be acquired through the market. This allows for economic development while ensuring adherence to overall carbon reduction goals.

**Private Sector Participation:**

**How it Helps:** Liquid carbon markets could attract greater participation from the private sector. Businesses can actively engage in emissions reduction efforts by buying and selling carbon liquidities, aligning their financial interests with environmental goals and contributing to a more sustainable economy.

**Carbon-Backed Financial Instruments:**

**How it Helps:** The creation of financial instruments backed by carbon liquidities, such as carbon futures or options, could provide businesses and investors with tools to manage and mitigate risks associated with emissions. This can enhance financial planning and encourage long-term sustainability.

**Public Awareness and Engagement:**

**How it Helps:** A liquid carbon market could be designed to include public participation, allowing individuals to buy and sell carbon liquidities. This engagement can increase public awareness and encourage environmentally conscious behavior, as individuals see a direct link between their actions and the carbon market.

While pegging CO2 as liquidities to currency exchanges introduces potential benefits, it's crucial to recognize that implementing such a system would still require careful design, international cooperation, and ongoing monitoring to ensure its effectiveness in promoting meaningful CO2 reduction. Additionally, considerations for potential market manipulation, regulatory frameworks, and social equity issues should be addressed in the development and implementation of this approach.

**The POLITICAL ECONOMY of CARBONCOIN**

A political economist would likely analyze the concept of pegging CO2 to currency exchanges from a multidimensional perspective, considering the economic, political, and social implications of such an approach. Here are some aspects a political economist might consider:

**Economic Efficiency:**

**Analysis:** A political economist would assess whether pegging CO2 to currency exchanges promotes economic efficiency by creating market-driven incentives for emissions reduction. They might evaluate the efficiency of the proposed carbon market in allocating resources and encouraging innovation in low-carbon technologies.

**What are the research results that support the thesis that as a result of human civilization, as a result of still increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the process of global warming in recent years has accelerated faster than previously predicted?**

A growing number of research centers analyzing the planet's climate in the long term, analyzing the progressive process of climate change, developing long-term forecast models of climate change, changes in ocean water temps are publishing the results of their research, which show that as a result of human civilizational activity, as a result of still increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the process of global warming in recent years has accelerated faster than previously predicted just a few years ago. These institutions include, among others, the international research team established at the UN and publishing IPCC reports. In addition to this, the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus also recently published the results of its ongoing research on the climate of planet Earth, which showed that in the 1st half of 2023, the average temp. of planet Earth's atmosphere was 16.8 degrees C. This is the highest temp. in the history of measurements. This is further evidence supporting the thesis that the global climate crisis has begun, and that the green economic transformation measures carried out in recent years, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, were definitely insufficient. In addition, in many countries, these actions have fallen far short of the pledges made at the UN Climate COP. Besides, the results of the aforementioned studies also support the thesis that the process of global warming in recent years has accelerated faster than previously predicted. This is a particularly important issue in the context of the living conditions of the next generations of people on the planet. Living conditions will rapidly deteriorate for many people on the planet in the not too distant future. Increasing summer heat, droughts, forest fires, weather anomalies, violent storms, drinking water shortages, deterioration of air quality, melting glaciers, rising water levels in the seas and oceans, shrinking areas of forests and other types of natural ecosystems, deterioration of the natural environment, progressive loss of biodiversity of natural ecosystems, extinction of pollinating insects and many other forms of life, etc. these are the key effects of the progressive global warming process, which will determine the deterioration of the quality of life on the planet for many people. In 2023 and 2024, the El Ninio effect is also an additional factor generating an increase in atmospheric temperature. However, according to the results of studies on the planet's climate, analyses of long-term climate change El Ninio is only an additional factor to the main factor is still the rapidly increasing greenhouse gas emissions generated by human civilization still based largely on the dirty combustion economy. However, there are many more research results also conducted by other institutions and research centers confirming the above theses. Please also provide other results of research conducted on this issue.

In view of the above, I address the following question to the esteemed community of scientists and researchers:

_What are the results of research supporting the thesis that, as a result of human civilization, as a result of still increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the process of global warming in recent years has accelerated faster than previously predicted?_

_Has the process of global warming in recent years accelerated faster than it was predicted just a few years ago?_

Two caveats to be begin:

Currency as money is liquid in nature. Any exchange in liquidation.

Carbon, on the other had, vapour based, or rather are solid specks suspended in vapour.

Somehow we need to formulate:

Money = Carbon Reduction.

The equal sign is the peg.

Carbon is neither a tax or credt, which is just a saving coupon. None has the peg. The peg is what keeps everything transparent, trackable, & exchangeable in terms. Think of it like returning to currencies pegged to the gold (a sold liquid) standard.

So a robust formulation of a peg carbon reduction must be agreed by all states.

Image Source: [https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/money-supply/](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wallstreetmojo.com%2Fmoney-supply%2F)

But personally adapted.

**Here´s what I propose, turning CO2 as Liquidity**

If we conceptualize CO2 as liquidity rather than a gas or vapor, we are essentially considering carbon dioxide as a form of tradable liquid asset that represents environmental impact. This approach adds an additional layer to the integration of CO2 into a financial system. Here's how this could be incorporated into the concept:

01. **CO2 Liquidity Units:** Instead of carbon credits, introduce the concept of CO2 liquidity units. These units would represent a standardized measure of carbon emissions that can be bought, sold, or traded in the market.

02. **Liquid Carbon Market:** Establish a liquid carbon market where entities, including businesses, governments, and individuals, can buy and sell CO2 liquidity units. This market would function similarly to financial markets where liquidity is traded.

03. **Carbon Liquidity Exchanges:** Create specialized carbon liquidity exchanges where participants can engage in the buying and selling of CO2 liquidity units. These exchanges would operate alongside traditional financial exchanges.

04. **Liquidity Providers:** Designate entities, such as environmental organizations or sustainable initiatives, as liquidity providers. These entities would contribute to the market by removing excess CO2 liquidity units from circulation through activities like carbon sequestration or environmental projects.

05. **Centralized Liquidity Authority:** Establish a centralized authority responsible for regulating and overseeing the CO2 liquidity market. This authority would manage the overall liquidity supply, adjusting it based on environmental goals and targets.

06. **Carbon-backed Liquidity Reserves:** Implement carbon-backed liquidity reserves to stabilize the value of CO2 liquidity units. These reserves would function similarly to central bank reserves in traditional financial systems.

07. **Carbon Liquidity-backed Financial Instruments:** Develop financial instruments, such as bonds or loans, that are backed by CO2 liquidity units. This would provide a way for financial markets to support sustainable projects, similar to green bonds.

08. **Liquidity-based Incentives:** Introduce incentives for entities to maintain or increase their liquidity levels. Those who reduce their carbon emissions and maintain a surplus of CO2 liquidity units could benefit financially, while those with deficits would face higher costs.

09. **Real-time Liquidity Monitoring:** Implement advanced monitoring systems for real-time tracking of carbon liquidity levels. This transparency would enable better decision-making and responsiveness to changes in environmental conditions.

10. **Education and Adoption:** Promote education and awareness about the CO2 liquidity system to ensure widespread understanding and adoption. Stakeholders, including businesses and individuals, need to grasp the concept of CO2 as a form of liquid asset.


This conceptualization aims to integrate the idea of liquidity into the carbon economy, treating CO2 as a tradable liquid asset with a value that can be influenced by market forces. It introduces the dynamics of supply, demand, and liquidity management into the broader context of environmental sustainability. As with any innovative financial system, careful planning, regulation, and adaptation are crucial for its successful implementation. Additionally, it's essential to consider potential unintended consequences and continually assess the system's effectiveness in achieving environmental goals.

The UN works seems not to even think about the need to link circular economic thinking with clean economy thinking so as to envision one day such a transition

Answer

The transition to an environmentally clean economy requires a multifaceted approach, and while reducing waste through circular economies can certainly be a part of that approach, it is unlikely to be sufficient on its own.

Circular economies can help reduce waste and improve resource efficiency, but they do not necessarily address other environmental challenges such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy, and protecting biodiversity. A comprehensive approach to the transition to an environmentally clean economy should involve a combination of measures, including circular economy strategies, clean energy development, sustainable land use practices, and policies to reduce pollution and protect natural ecosystems.

Furthermore, circular economies themselves must also be designed with environmental considerations in mind, as not all circular economy models are necessarily sustainable or environmentally beneficial. For example, a circular economy that relies heavily on the use of fossil fuels or other environmentally damaging practices may not be effective in achieving environmental goals.

In summary, while circular economies can certainly contribute to the transition to an environmentally clean economy, they are unlikely to be the sole solution. A comprehensive approach that includes multiple strategies and takes into account the environmental impacts of circular economy models is needed to achieve a truly sustainable and environmentally

Question

**Why are the results of scientific research, including the UN IPCC reports on the role of humans on the sources of the accelerating global warming process, being ignored under populist, opportunistic, dirty combustion energy sector-backed economic policies, including pseudo-climate policies?**

Published in March 2023, the new report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of UN scientists summarises the previous 6 IPCC reports produced and published between 2018 and 2022. These reports have involved a huge amount of scientific work, many thousands of scientific papers have been examined. Thousands of scientific reviews were produced, in which around 100,000 different aspects, comments etc. were included and reviewed. The analysis shows, among other things, that more than 99 per cent of the scientific papers support the thesis that human civilisation has led to a significant and accelerating increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the first industrial revolution, which has become a key factor in the increasingly rapid process of global warming. Studies and estimates show that 2.5 trillion tonnes of CO2 have been released into the atmosphere since the mid-19th century, with half of this amount entering the atmosphere in the last three decades. It has been estimated that 3.5 billion people are at risk of serious negative impacts from the ongoing global warming process. According to the results of the study, the processes of green transformation of the economy should be significantly accelerated, including the rate of decarbonisation of economic processes. without this acceleration, the strategic goal of global climate policy established during the Paris Agreement in 2015, which is to limit the scale of the increase in the temperature of the planet's atmosphere to max. 1.5 degrees C since the beginning of the first industrial revolution, i.e. since the 17th century. In order for this goal to be realistically achievable, it is necessary to significantly accelerate the implementation of the green transformation of the economy, so as to halve CO2 emissions by 2030 at the latest and achieve total zero-emission of the economy by 2050. Unfortunately, the populist, opportunistic economic policies supported by the dirty combustion energy sector, including pseudo-climatic policies, continue to ignore the results of scientific research, including the UN IPCC reports on the role of man as regards the sources of the increasingly rapid process of global warming.

In view of the above, I address the following question to the esteemed community of scientists and researchers:

_Why are the results of scientific research, including the UN IPCC reports on the role of man regarding the sources of the accelerating process of global warming, being ignored in the framework of populist, opportunistic, dirty combustion energy sector-supported economic policies, including pseudo-climate policies?_

Answer

The primary beneficiaries of blocking the transition from the environmentally dirty economy to the environmentally clean economy are those who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. This could include corporations and industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels and other non-renewable energy sources, as well as governments that are heavily invested in such industries. Additionally, those who are not ready to commit to the costly investments necessary for transitioning to a cleaner economy also benefit from delaying the process. Finally, those who are resistant to change and/or resistant to environmental regulations can also benefit from blocking the transition.

**When will the green transformation include avionics? When will hydrogen-oxygen-fueled aircraft be developed? When will emission-free aviation based on hydrogen-oxygen jet technology be developed? When will passenger and cargo planes powered by hydrogen-oxygen jet engines be built?**

Since space shuttles, which were already built several decades ago, flew to the planet's orbit and were powered by hydrogen-oxygen fuel, it should be technically possible to build passenger and cargo planes powered by hydrogen-oxygen jet engines.

With the urgent transition to a zero-carbon economy, there is growing pressure to extend the green transition to avionics as well, i.e. to build zero-emission, zero-greenhouse-gas-emitting aircraft, and hydrogen-oxygen jet engines are such a solution. In the future, as part of the zero-carbon economy, such technological solutions should become widespread, and thus the green transformation should also include the aviation sector. _The question then arises, when will this happen? When will avionics also be pro-environmentally transformed as part of the pro-environmental transformation of the economy and reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere?_

Answer

Despite the strong lobby of the oil sector and the energy sector based on coal combustion, thanks to the technological progress and the growing environmental and pro-climate awareness of citizens, the interest of companies and enterprises in the commercialization of hydrogen production processes for the development of zero-emission, clean hydrogen energy is growing. For this purpose, i.a. Solar and / or wind farms are built to generate the electricity needed to produce hydrogen. Nuclear energy, too, and a future nuclear fusion, could prove to be of great help in this matter. Some companies that, for example, already mass-produce hydrogen cars, have developed strategies for the development of hydrogen energy taking into account various sectors and industries of the economy. In the future, hydrogen energy will supply energy not only to mechanical vehicles, passenger and space planes, but also to be a source of energy for enterprises, residential buildings, etc.

Question

7 answers

- 21 May 2022

Good afternoon!

I am currently a master’s degree candidate studying Research and Evaluation in Education. I’m currently exploring the text _Research and Evaluation in Education and Psychology_(Mertens, 2020). The premise of the text is to look at differences and similarities between research and evaluation. My undergraduate work is in Earth Sciences with a focus on research (specifically seismology and carbon emission connections). If “research is primarily empirical and evaluation is about drawing conclusions about merit or worth” (Rogers, 2014) is it important that we as educators are teaching both methods to our primary and secondary students? Or is one more beneficial to act as a building block to the education of future scientists?

After reading the text, as well as other literature on the subject, the fundamental purpose of research is to produce more generalized knowledge of a particular subject. Evaluation is the process of applying that knowledge to a specific topic. Research is more theoretical and controlled by the researcher, whereas evaluation is controlled by those commissioning the study. The two may be intertwined or independent of each other.

In exploring the four paradigms that frame research and evaluation, described as post-positivism, constructivism, transformative and pragmatic by Mertens (2020), I’m interested if you feel that one category is most suitable for engaging secondary science students? I’m leaning toward pragmatism, but would certainly appreciate your opinions and feedback. Do you feel that one paradigm is more reachable by secondary students?

I appreciate your time!

Best,

Annie Callahan

Answer

I believe the fundamentals of Research and Evaluation should be taught in senior secondary schools. These students already engage in Research without actually knowing. Mostly, I give students topics and concepts to find out more about; they browse or ask people who are more informed so as to have a clearer understanding: That is Research.

For Evaluation, these students are supposed to have knowledge of how they're rated and implications of low ratings. More importantly they should be taught to read their graded scripts, understand the teacher's comments and take corrections as feedback for an improved Learning outcome.

Answer

“Net-zero emissions” sounds a lot like “zero emissions” but can actually mean something quite different. A "net-zero" climate goal essentially means that as long as a company or government says it will remove the same amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it pollutes, it can claim to be "net" zero. That may sound good for the climate. But in reality, this poses many problems, not least because it is very difficult to remove CO2 from the atmosphere on a large scale.

Instead of planning to reduce emissions to truly zero, most “net zero” climate goals plan to continue polluting for decades, while hoping that trees or new technologies will suck the CO2 out of the air to solve the problem. Net-zero goals serve as a smokescreen to allow companies to continue business as usual while appearing more ambitious than they actually are.

Unfortunately, if you add up all the carbon offsets from the hundreds upon hundreds of “Net-Zero” targets announced by governments and corporations so far, it will take hundreds of millions of hectares of new tree plantations – wasteland that the planet does not have. Everyone mistakenly assumes that the land available to solve the problem is endless. But this is not the case.

Answer

I think the major car manufacturers already have at least one or two electric car models (I cannot actually name each of them for I don't know that much.) But I understand the strategy is that "good amounts of net profits from market IC cars is going into R&D, innovation side of the electric vehicles which is definitely a good sign that they are getting ready for the shift." The rise in jobs for power electronics and electrical machines within electric vehicle sector also signifies this fact. Personally, I was getting many calls from automotive sector as an electrical engineer.

But I think we need to see the numbers of new refineries or extensions that are happening all over the world too in terms of new projects. This shows us how much is going into investing under petroleum refineries. but that can be again for textiles or chemical manufacturing.

The shift from IC to EV will take longer in developing countries as everyone knows, that way, the major car manufacturers know that they still need to innovate in IC vehicles as well.

I want to know if anyone gives statistics for some of my answers. I can evaluate my approach towards it then!

"Published a review paper on Hydrogen production with our collaborators from Iran and China" Do you know Hydrogen is future fuel which will replace other non renewal energy sources and will help to stop carbon emission and control global environmental changes.

Hydrogen is an energy carrier that can be used in internal combustion engines or fuel cells producing virtually no greenhouse gas emissions when combusted with oxygen. The only significant emission is water vapour.

[Bitcoin, climate change and sustainability](post/Bitcoin_climate_change_and_sustainability)

Question

28 answers

- 4 Nov 2021

Bitcoin mining requires large computing power and therefore large amounts of electricity. Most of the electricity used by Bitcoin miners around the world comes from fossil fuel power plants. This leads to global carbon emissions and environmental pollution. In November 2021, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimated that Bitcoin’s annualized power consumption is 115 TWh, which is almost as large as the annual electricity consumption of Poland – a country with 38 million citizens. Given the large and growing environmental concerns across the world and the planned actions of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin applications negative? Is Bitcoin cursed with its inherent ‘proof of work’ and mining mechanism? Are the long-term external costs of the Bitcoin ecosystem too large as compared with the potential benefits offered by this cryptocurrency? Is the demise of Bitcoin inevitable in the long term? Can ways be found whereby Bitcoin’s negative environmental impact might be significantly reduced?

Electric cars have been introduced world wide with the idea that there will be some decrease in carbon footprints along with decrease in air pollution. But we have to charge an electric car on regular basis. From where that energy will come, is a big question. Some countries have hydel power generation, and some have thermal energy, the other may have solar also.

Second question is about water, air and soil pollution? If we shifted from air pollution to water and/or soil pollution, we have the ability to handle such mega scale pollutions?

In the light of the above, what is your analysis and views?

In addition, I investigate the integration of (HVAC) systems to renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. The research area that I work on, as an indirect result, causes the decrease of carbon emission in the electricity generating industry. My question is: With my research profile can I be part of this work team?

[In your view, is the world doing enough on climate change?](post/In_your_view_is_the_world_doing_enough_on_climate_change)

Question

57 answers

- 29 Dec 2019

Decades of rising emissions continued to do what scientists have long warned they would: make the world hotter.

Indeed, the 2010s mark the decade when the impacts from climate change became unmistakable, at least for any objective-minded observer.

Carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, which makes up about 90% of total emissions from human activities, was relatively flat from 2013 through 2016.

However, Fossil-fuel emissions rose an estimated 0.6% to a record 37 billion metric tons in 2019, capping three straight years of growth.

**Sea-level rise is accelerating!!**

**The planet got a lot hotter this decade!!**

**Most countries have done very little** so far to displace the power plants, cars, factories, and buildings polluting the atmosphere with more emissions each year.

In your view, is the world doing enough on climate change?

Dear experts,

Liquid carbon dots (CDs ) were synthesized with greenish color under UV-light. However, after mixing with PVA polymer, the color turned to blue with enhanced quantum yield (QY). what is the possible interaction made this enhancement? Is it related to hydrogen bonds of PVA or other reasons. Thanks in advance.

- 18 Mar 2020

Answer

Look carefully at your data. since You list quantum yield, I assume the color is fluorescence. Was the original fluorescence green or a combination of blue and yellow - but now the yellow is gone? If it is a shift in the color from green to blue (higher energy, greater difference between the excited and ground states), either the ground state is stabilized or the excited state destabilized.

I am currently evaluating my ecobrick activity. I created this Ecobrick by compressing plastic packaging waste into a bottle to a certain weight, for that, I want to calculate how much carbon I have stored so far. The carbon calculation formula that I refer to is still based on the IPCC which is sourced from carbon emissions of the incinerator when the plastic is burned. But in my opinion, each type of plastic will have its own combustion speed and will produce different carbon dioxide emissions.

Answer

Global warming refers to the upward temperature trend across the entire Earth since the early 20th century, and most notably since the late 1970s, due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions since the industrial revolution. Worldwide since 1880, the average surface temperature has gone up by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F), relative to the mid-20th-century baseline (of 1951-1980). Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels, which add heat-trapping gases to Earth’s atmosphere. These phenomena include the increased temperature trends described by global warming, but also encompass changes such as sea level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant blooming; and extreme weather events.

Both issues are very serious and need due attention and the required effort to control these phenomena. I am agree with Dr Nafees Mohammad that no concrete policy has been adopted to fight against these serious problems.

Answer

HI, you can find a time series of national emissions, 1990-2012, for each country and Malaysia, on FAOSTAT, here: [http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EM](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fao.org%2Ffaostat%2Fen%2F%23data%2FEM). With reference to AFOLU emissions only, our time series extends to 2016. Data can be found here: [http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fao.org%2Ffaostat%2Fen%2F%23data%2FGT) (agriculture) and here: [http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GL](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fao.org%2Ffaostat%2Fen%2F%23data%2FGL) (land use).

Answer

Not sure if there is an official method. But my approach would be something like:

1\. Look up statistics for waste generation in an proxy area that is similar to the area you are interested in.

2\. Look up the share of degradable materials in waste from these areas. Maybe subdivided in Fast degradable (food waste etc.) and slower degradable (wood, paper etc.).

3\. Use either the IPCC values for finding methane production rates, or use one of the freely available models for calculating this.

Here the US EPA landgem model can be used

[http://www.waste.ccacoalition.org/document/landfill-gas-emissions-model-landgem-version-302](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.waste.ccacoalition.org%2Fdocument%2Flandfill-gas-emissions-model-landgem-version-302)

Or the slightly more complex model from Avfalzorg.

[http://www.afvalzorg.nl/en/About-us/News/methane-generation-model.aspx](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.afvalzorg.nl%2Fen%2FAbout-us%2FNews%2Fmethane-generation-model.aspx)

I would probably choose the latter model, as it has some predefined data. So if you base it on this, you just need to choose what type of waste is in your landfill from some set types (defined earlier, but where you can get inspired here), and how has it been landfilled, what is the type of landfill (shallow or deep), and a few other settings. And it will then give you the year by year and commulative rates of methane.

Good luck with finding the answer

[Huw Jones](profile/Huw-Jones-2)

- 14 Mar 2018

Answer

Though not exactly benefiting a particular organism, certain phenotypes of an organism have benefited from air pollution. The most well known example of this, commonly taught in evolutionary biology classes, is the case of the peppered moth, the first documented example of "industrial melanism" where the dominance of the white bodied type (Biston betularia f. typica) was superseded by the black type (Biston betularia f. carbonaria). The black type became dominant by virtue of its improved camouflage from predators caused by black carbon emissions darkening tree and other surfaces where the species rested. The effect was first observed by entomologist James William Tutt in the late 19th century following decades of industrial pollution in the Manchester region of the United Kingdom. The effect was studied more closely by Bernard Kettlewell in the 1950s. Following the Clean Air Act (1956) air quality improved and the white type, being better camouflaged against lighter coloured tree lichen- covered surfaces returned to dominance.

Answer

Insufficient combustion! The ratio of fuel/oxidizer may be too lean or too rich. Temperature too low.

Remember, you are trying to combust everything to Carbon Dioxide which is the final end product.

Question

3 answers

- 14 Oct 2013

I am currently researching the emission variations between agricultural land and energy crop cultivation. There is extensive literature about the argument of preserving agricultural land for food production and keeping energy crop production separate. This is primarily due to the increasing demand of food and decreasing available land for such agriculture.

My research has led me to the understanding that there are additional carbon emissions that need to be accounted for when calculating the environmental impacts of energy crops. This is due to previously stored carbon in the soils of uncultivated land, such as grassland, which is released once cultivation begins.

Is anyone working on or know of a study that has extensively calculated the emissions of both separate land uses and/or the variations between the same piece of land being used for agriculture and then converted into energy crops?

Answer

All significant car manufacturers publish their cars LCAs: [https://www.audi.com/content/dam/com/EN/corporate-responsibility/product/audi\_a6\_life\_cycle\_assessment.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.audi.com%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fcom%2FEN%2Fcorporate-responsibility%2Fproduct%2Faudi_a6_life_cycle_assessment.pdf)

Also, you can find the abundance of scientific literature of car LCAs on google scholar: [http://papers.sae.org/971166/](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fpapers.sae.org%2F971166%2F)

In the case of car manufacturing, CO2 causes the global warming impact and not other GHGs. You look up the used LCA model and can calculate the CO2 if it is not explicitly presented in the study.

You can get the data from scratch as well. Draw the process map. Look up steel production, transportation, manufacturing CO2 releases from available databases (EPA, EU stat) and add together. It takes time.

Please find my study about a simpler product (torrefied wood). I built the emissions from bottom up by using EPA databases, the process map and calculated mass/energy balances:

Answer

From the long term work of Rattan Lay at Ohio State University which started in 1964 the ability of no till maize monoculture with no cover crop has a value of 330 kg/ha roughly pounds per acre of long term carbon sequestration. This is not trivial as a projection would indicate converting to no till on all tilled acreage would counteract 10% of the total present greenhouse gas emissions. In relation to long term work on cover crops at the Rodale Insitute, Beltsville USDA and University of California show long term carbon sequestration at 3 to 4 times the no till rate. In work with compost and biochar the potential for long term gains are simillarly impressive. The advantage of this approach is that it improves the enironment and the core productivity of our food systems. Likewise over twice the tillage acreage is range land which is ideally suitable for long term soil carbon and nitrogen gains counteracting the issues with greenhouse gases. In terms of Kenneth remarks about the lack of value in projections I will agree to disagree. Projections are not always completely true but they give a basis for testing and proving and evolving the thinking on how the global mechansism works and what can be done to help it work better.

Answer

Algal bloom is a much more complex process, oxygenation conditions are also influenced by temperature, in low-temperature waters the oxygen dissolves in a higher amount.Waves also produce better oxygenation by increasing the air-water contact surface.Water transparency also influences the photosynthesis process,for example in the Mediterranean Sea the waters have a much better transparency than the Black Sea. The fine particles of the substrate in the Black Sea are entrained by waves and reduce the transparency and penetration of light to the algae in the coastal area.

Excessive nutrients are just one of the causes in algal bloom process.

Answer

One of biggest pollutant its oil and gas fields when they burn off  gas associate with crude oil, the point is incomplete combustion lead to more smoke and CO2 in atmosphere so CO2 and NOx are harmful emissions which can be reduce by using bio-fuels or natural gas.

Answer

Using bioenergy for useful purposes captures some of the chemical energy stored in the biofuel as the C component completes its cycle back to CO2.  It's rapid C churning, and the whole cycle needs to be reviewed, including alternative uses of the biofuel, to know the net effect
