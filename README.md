### App Deployment

#### Overview
This application contains the code for deploying my chatbot on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio. 

#### Deployment Process
After determining that Variant 2 was the best-performing model, I took the following steps to deploy it:

1. **Model Selection**: Selected Variant 2 as the optimal model based on performance metrics.
2. **Hugging Face Spaces**: Registered for a Hugging Face account to access the platform's features.
3. **Integration with Gradio**: 
   - Utilized Gradio to create an interactive web interface for the chatbot.
   - The Gradio library allows for easy integration and deployment of machine learning models with minimal code.
4. **Deployment to Free CPU**: 
   - Deployed the chatbot on Hugging Face Spaces, choosing the free CPU option to minimize costs while testing the deployment.
   - Leveraged Hugging Face’s seamless deployment process to quickly bring the chatbot online.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation included in this repository to better understand the deployment process and the functionality of the chatbot.
