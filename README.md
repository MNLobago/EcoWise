## How to Use `app.py`

`app.py` is the main script for running the EcoWise chatbot, providing an interactive interface for users.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.6 or higher**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries by running:

  ```bash
  pip install gradio keras-nlp huggingface-hub psutil
  ```

- **Hugging Face API Key**: Sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and obtain your API token.

### Execute the Script

Run the `app.py` script using Python, supplying your Hugging Face API key as an argument:

```bash
python app.py <Hugging_face_api_key>
```

Replace `Hugging_face_api_key>` with your actual API key.

### Interact with the Chatbot

Upon successful execution, an interactive Gradio interface will open in your default web browser. You can start chatting with the EcoWise chatbot by typing your questions related to environmental sustainability and climate change.
