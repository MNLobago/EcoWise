[Does Mean Residence Time (MRT) and Elemental Ratio give better understanding about Biochar Carbon stability?](post/Does_Mean_Residence_Time_MRT_and_Elemental_Ratio_give_better_understanding_about_Biochar_Carbon_stability)

Question

4 answers

- 12 Jan 2020

As MRT express the decay rate (average time that biochar can persist from decaying) and this rate decreases with time. Therefore, the incubation period becomes pivotal for the MRT calculation because shorter duration may lead to higher estimated mineralization rate and shorter MRT. So, can we consider other means of getting justifiable stability period?

please suggest a methodology for above.

Salam all. according to the reported work in the literature, some authors used strong acid (like refluxing with HNo3) in conjugation with carbon-based precursor, while others used base such as NaOH. It is well known that base can act as corrosive agent to accelerate the breakdown process of carbonaceous materials and at the same time provide CDs with OH groups. So what is the advantages of using strong acid? which one is more favorable to enhance the fluorescent quantum yield of CDs , acid or base?

Answer

caLAm

actually, strong acids are not necessary to produce normal blue fluorescent C dots. the main reason for using strong acids and bases or trying new precursors is to improve QY and photo-stability or engineering the emitted and adsorbed light to reach the NIR region. to achieve this goal it is needed to work on the C dot inner structure.

I am working on the same area and I found this recently published review paper amazingly useful, all recent studies are summarized and very good mechanism explanations are gathered. hope you can use this article to understand the mechanism better.

With increasing world population, agriculture has to do more using intensive agricultural systems to feed this growing population. However, the use of intensive agricultural systems usually is associated with more Greenhouse Gases (GHG) released to the atmosphere contributing to climate changes.

The concept of carbon footprint has gained some attention recently as a tool to measure the contribution of the process of producing any product to the release of GHG.

How effectively can we use this tool in agriculture to contribute to the mitigation of climate changes?

Answer

The idea of carbon footprint is to monitor our impacts on the atmosphere by reducing the amount of CO2 we emit into it. Carbon dioxide and methane are the biggest culprits in the climate change debate. Hence any activity that reduces the generation and release of Carbon dioxide and methane is a worthwhile activity as we strive hard to combat climate change. Agriculture is one area where we can reduce our carbon footprint. The beef industry for instance produces a lot of methane which eventually gets converted into carbon dioxide and causes global warming. Farmers can however reduce the amount of methane produced for every kg of beef produced. One of the key drivers is days to slaughter; an animal that is finished at 16 months compared to one at 30 months will have emitted substantially less methane during its lifetime. Therefore optimising animal performance is key. Genetics, animal health and nutrition all play a key role when it comes to the performance of any animal. This is something that farmers need to improve on.

Some oils such as linseed, coconut, garlic and cotton oil are considered to be amongst the most effective additives for methane mitigation. Adding fats to the cow's diet offers a promising solution for reducing methanogenesis, without having a significant negative impact on other functions of the cattle.

[Douglas Nuttall](profile/Douglas-Nuttall)

- 3 Aug 2019

Answer

No - the mass of the air it mixes with, not the volume. And within a very few years it can be assumed to be fully mixed.

So, if the atmosphere has a pressure of 101.15 kPa at the earth's surface, in a gravitational field of 9.81 N/kg, then there is a mass of 10.3 T of air over every square meter of land, which turns into 5.26 e18 kg. If the atmosphere was 'thick' relative to the diameter of the earth, then the calculation would be much more sophisticated. As the vast majority of the atmosphere is within 100km of the surface, and the radius o the planet is about 6400 km, it is relatively 'thin', so this complexity can be ignored.

So, 1000T of CO2 adds 1.9e-7 ppm to what is there right now.

Answer

since about one half of the total cereal grain carbon foot print is for supplemental nitrogen the use of legumes is highly recommended. The use of legumes and the organic amendment of manures and composts can eliminate any requirement for supplemental nitrogen.

Besides carbon footprint the ability to get carbon sequestration from the agricultural system can be critical. In the monsoon environment of India the efficiency of water usage is dependent of the soil organic matter which has largely been depleted in may subcontinent areas. One of the best ways to increasing both soil organic matter and the ability to have high crop production is the integration of the plant and animal systems. When winter small grain can be used to establish a permanent mixed forage this stimulates a grassland type of environment which maximizes soil improvement.

Beside the establishment of legume foundation and mixed agricultural system the efficiency of the system depend on getting the high soil pH and balancing the soil nutrition through addressing deficiencies and toxicities.

By focusing on the biological input in the soil the requirements for agrichemical inputs and their issues can be avoided. The use of tillage practices can aid by using no till methods and substituting biological controls for the agrichemical.s

The system approach starts with a baselining of the soil conditions the use of soil analysis which leads to soil conservation and remediation plan.

The periodic assay of the soil and plant analyses serves as a way of monitoring and indicating when adjustments are needed.

This type of approach would ideally utilize teams of farmers and scientists who can interact together in the goals which would be applied in generalized regional approaches to extend the benefits from the approach and use the input efficiently.

Practices of production can be quantified for their carbon footprint and the results on the soil are used to determine sequestration as ongoing evaluation and adaptation.

Answer

[Brian Collins](profile/Brian-Collins-6) , sorry for not reading the question properly,

_**"...make an hour / a unit of mathematical calculations with a computer possible and how much emission is created..."**_

it seems your objective is to quantify the pollution load (such as carbon footprint, water footprints) for a unit run of your computer.

In that context, I agree with what [Tomasz Nitkiewicz](profile/Tomasz-Nitkiewicz) and

Davide Tosches

suggested. Energy consumption and computer life loss are the important factors to be considered (consumptions). These data available at standard LCA data bases like ecoinvent. then you may need a software like SimaPro (or openLCA) or simple excel program.

However, I would like to open up your objectives and scope bit more.

For example, lets see the possibilities of social and other gains. Some computers consume more energy but need more human assistance to complete the mathematical calculation. then lets say the operator has to switch on the screen and press a key. Some may not required. in such cases, there is social/health and other aspects to be considers (I understand your objective is not a research but a simple calculation), but then **Why are you doing this?** with that question, then we can agree with what [Gianvito Scaringi](profile/Gianvito-Scaringi) said."firm or your university spends electricity to feed your computer, this is already accounted for".

Answer

Dear Bartek,

welcome,

The perovskite solar cells has to go long way before commercialization for using in the field. This is because the instability of the solar cells in the long run. In addition to the toxic lead inclusion in the solar cells.

Any how this is not the major issue of the question raised here. As the perovskite solar cell is fabricated at low temperature hence it will consume much lower energy for fabrication even less than the polycrystalline silicon. I would assume to save the same increment of energy as the difference from single to polycrystal.

As per your data in the question this energy increment of 700 MJ/m^2.

So i would assume that the pervoskite panels will consume about 3300 MJ/m^2

with emission of 172 kg CO2/m^2

Best wishes

A good scientific needs to travel in order to diffuse results and learn from colleges. Yet there is a carbon footprint for all this activity.

My question is how to achieve a good scientific career with a minimal carbon footprint.

So please share your opinions and estimates about this point, for example, correlations between h factor and carbon footprint, etc, etc.

Some strategies that I use are:

a) When travel, try to optimize conferences by carefully design a meeting plan. For example, make 1 flight per year to Europe, but use trains to go to many meetings once you are in Europe. Visit colleges who work nearby your landing place.

b) Find nearby meetings, accessible by train or short flights.

c) Use virtual conferences

d) See videos from important meetings.

e) Plant trees by yourself each year

Answer

Global warming refers to the upward temperature trend across the entire Earth since the early 20th century, and most notably since the late 1970s, due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions since the industrial revolution. Worldwide since 1880, the average surface temperature has gone up by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F), relative to the mid-20th-century baseline (of 1951-1980). Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels, which add heat-trapping gases to Earth’s atmosphere. These phenomena include the increased temperature trends described by global warming, but also encompass changes such as sea level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant blooming; and extreme weather events.

Both issues are very serious and need due attention and the required effort to control these phenomena. I am agree with Dr Nafees Mohammad that no concrete policy has been adopted to fight against these serious problems.

I do not think the method is different than in any other businesses. Maybe if you want to choose the right functional unit, like CO2/ students successfully finished. Potentially you can calculate net carbon footprint, especially if you have dormitories, you can consider that your students would have there own carbon footprint somewhere else, maybe larger than in your community.

Answer

Dear Drlatief Ahmad, it is an interesting issue.

The agriculture sector contributes significantly to global carbon emissions from diverse sources such as product and machinery manufacture, transport of materials and direct and indirect soil greenhouse gas emissions.

Scientists defined carbon foot print as a measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide and methane emissions of a defined population, system or activity, considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population, system or activity of interest. Calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent using the relevant 100-year global warming potential (GWP100).

I have found an interesting article on related to this issue and please go through it.

Every day, we produce tons of carbon and add it into the atmosphere as we move on with our daily lives. We’ve been using – rather abusing – fossil fuels as a source of energy since the industrial revolution, and have done considerable damage to the globe. Our carbon footprints will remain in the atmosphere for at least another hundred years.

There are several problems associated with using fossil fuels as a source of energy. It took millions of years for plant and animal matter to decay, compress and turn into fossil fuels beneath the surface of the earth. It cannot be regenerated at the same rate at which we use them. Sooner or later, we are bound to run out of it

With the advancement of science and technology, we have come to realize that we don’t need to burn fossil fuels any more to power our houses, automobiles and factories. We have sources that are sustainable and renewable...so we thinking to fined alternatives ways....

The largest solar farm in Africa, the Jasper PV Project located in South Africa, was completed in October 2014, with the capacity to to deliver 180,000 megawatt-hours of electricity every year to over 80,000 homes. In mid-2015, the Africa Progress Panel launched a report that set out a plan to make electricity accessible to every single person on the African continent by 2030. The report, titled Power, People, Planet, Africa, called for this to be done with renewable electricity, effectively asking leaders of African nations to leapfrog using fossil fuels. The Africa Progress Panel aims to provide low-cost solar panels that would make energy accessible to the 621 million people lacking access to electricity today. The estimated amount of money needed is 55 billion USD. According to the Panel, half this amount could be generated from within the African continent by increasing sub-Saharan Africa's tax-to GDP ratio by one percent of GDP. Another 20 billion would come from a new 'connectivity fund' of which half would come from Africa itself and another half from bilateral aid.

The concept of water footprint is primarily rooted in the links between water use and water resource management vis-a-vis crop performance. Likewise, carbon footprint of a crop is an indication , how good or bad , the given crop is , with regard to adoption or mitigation of the kind of stresses the crop is exposed . These concepts are interchangeably utilised to define the production sustainability of a given crops or cropping sequence . And often , beyond the sustainability of agriculture , carbon and water footprints are used to define the type of climate change and its ultimate implications as well. In this background , i propose the following questions to our learned colleagues to share their wisdom :

\\* What is water footprint accounting?

\\* How are water footprint and nutrient density of a crop related to each other?

\\* How are water footprint and soil fertility related to each other ?

\\* What is the maximum sustainable limit of water footprint ?. What kind of relation, does it display with crop performance sustainability ?

\\* How does origin and characteristics of water and carbon footprints affect the sustainability of agriculture?

\\* What is the consequential effect(s) of changes in water footprint or carbon footprint on crop performance ?

Answer

Carbon footprint and water footprint of a crop are inter-related. The water footprint within a geographically delineated area – be it a province, nation, catchment area or river basin – is equal to the sum of the water footprints of all processes taking place in that area. The total water footprint of humanity is equal to the sum of the water footprints of all consumers of the world, which is equal to the sum of the water footprints of all final consumer goods and services consumed annually and also equal to the sum of all water-consuming or polluting processes in the world.

Answer

**Abstract:** y importing food and agricultural goods, countries cope with the heterogeneous global water distribution and often rely on water resources available abroad. The virtual displacement of the water used to produce such goods (known as _virtual water_) connects together, in a global water system, all countries participating to the international trade network. Local food-production crises, having social, economic or environmental origin, propagate in this network, modifying the virtual water trade and perturbing local and global food availability, quantified in terms of virtual water. We analyze here the possible effects of local crises by developing a new propagation model, parsimonious but grounded on data-based and statistically-verified assumptions, whose effectiveness is proved on the Argentinean crisis in 2008–09. The model serves as the basis to propose indicators of crisis impact and country vulnerability to external food-production crises, which highlight that countries with largest water resources have the highest impact on the international trade, and that not only water-scarce but also wealthy and globalized countries are among the most vulnerable to external crises. The temporal analysis reveals that global average vulnerability has increased over time and that stronger effects of crises are now found in countries with low food (and water) availability. Source ;

**Global effects of local food-production crises: a virtual water perspective,** _Scientific Reports_ **6**, Article number: 18803 (2016)doi:10.1038/srep18803

**Abstrac** t: Water can be redistributed through, in physical terms, water transfer projects and virtually, embodied water for the production of traded products. Here, we explore whether such water redistributions can help mitigate water stress in China. This study, for the first time to our knowledge, both compiles a full inventory for physical water transfers at a provincial level and maps virtual water flows between Chinese provinces in 2007 and 2030. Our results show that, at the national level, physical water flows because of the major water transfer projects amounted to 4.5% of national water supply, whereas virtual water flows accounted for 35% (varies between 11% and 65% at the provincial level) in 2007. Furthermore, our analysis shows that both physical and virtual water flows do not play a major role in mitigating water stress in the water-receiving regions but exacerbate water stress for the water-exporting regions of China. Future water stress in the main water-exporting provinces is likely to increase further based on our analysis of the historical trajectory of the major governing socioeconomic and technical factors and the full implementation of policy initiatives relating to water use and economic development. Improving water use efficiency is key to mitigating water stress, but the efficiency gains will be largely offset by the water demand increase caused by continued economic development. We conclude that much greater attention needs to be paid to water demand management rather than the current focus on supply-oriented management.Physical and virtual water transfers for regional water stress alleviation in China.

Life Cycle Analysis plays significant role in many research proposals and is one of the main significant criteria that exist during the evaluation process. It’s mainly used (beside others) to calculate the carbon footprint of several operations and or several procedures. However, remain unclear if a complete and detailed LCA can be done, in order to compare with the state of the art. In addition, this because systems boundaries can change all the time.

Answer

It depends on your target. Comparative LCAs work very well. Establishing an environmental impact analysis for the life of a product is a different animal. LCA impact categories hide details. The methodology of the LCA, the approach, and the standardized impact categories, data bases are pretty useful.

I prefer to work with raw data, have the process map, analyze all emissions and impacts one by one, or choose the significant ones as indicators. For climate change impact I vot for using emission calculations instead of LCA.

Europe uses more than 800,000 tons of charcoal every year. Production of one ton of wood-based charcoal requires between 5 and 12 tons of wood. Approximately 70% of the charcoal utilized in Europe annually, (that is, 570,000 tons), is imported. Incidentally, Nigeria is the biggest charcoal supplier to Europe. Namibia, Egypt, South Africa, and Ivory Coast also export to Europe. On the whole, Africa supplies 40% of all European charcoal imports (TFT research, 2015). Nigeria supplied 24% of wood charcoal imported in Europe in 2013 (FAO, 2013).

Nigeria, a major supplier of charcoal to the EU has some of the highest levels of deforestation in the world (Olden, 2015).

It becomes expedient to ask: what is the true cost of charcoal production in Africa?

To my knowledge, you can apply Life Cycle Assessment (LCA, from ISO 14040:2006) and select the scope that suits the purpose of the analysis. Do you want to assess the raw material extraction and production of the machine (cradle to gate) or also the use phase and disposal of it? (cradle to gate). If you consider the use phase, you need to estimate the production demand and the product mix to be processed by the machine. I have found two articles that might be of interest to you:

Answer

Water laws and rights can vary with country and location.  In USA, we have western water laws that are different from eastern laws.  Very simply, the western laws give priority to those first appliers for water rights, and the eastern laws (riparian water rights) give each landowner with water flowing across land some right to reasonable use.  There are also public waters managed by the states and in some instances Crown lands with water rights that may be reserved such on federal lands.  I remember some mining water rights granted in western USA, but do not think there was any royalty for the water.  The eastern USA has some difference in mining as well as water laws, but I am still not familiar with any royalty payments for the water, but a negotiation would occur if a miner was going to mine on lands not owned, but the royalty is probably a percentage of the minerals, such as 10%.  As far as hydroelectric, I am not specifically aware of royalties paid, usually the lands are acquired and former landowners paid for land by agreement or condemnation if a public project.  On private lands, use of water for generating power may be granted a water right in the west if applied for, however some of the run of the stream generators that do not require dams may be working without any right to water or any royalties involved.  In the east US, a landowner can make a reasonable use of water, but would need permits to build a dam and control water.  I am not aware of any royalties to do this as long as other riparian right users are not affected and minimum instream flows for aquatic organisms are maintained.

There is some potential for payment of royalties for use of land and resources, and also potential for incurring costs for water quality or quantity mitigation from both mining and various hydroelectric projects, but each circumstance may be more of a case by case analysis, than any well defined rules or regulations that apply to all.  In USA, there are several to many laws to consider  relative to these activities and that is why development of dams and various types of mining operations with surface damages are likely to need an Environmental Analysis of varying intensity and possibly permits before proceeding.  In some instances, the use of the public waters involves permitting with costs of various types and a degree of taxation that is not a royalty, but does return some of the proceeds back for public benefit.

In addition, some activities such as panning for gold or using very small dredges in washed channel substrates or very small headwater hydroelectric generators for home use that do not require dams or inchannel structures are sometimes exempted or limited from most regulation if their effects are negligible.

Answer

Kenneth M Towe, Boris and Colleagues,

The two graphs still show the mismatch, and why not!! The 2 billion increase in population between 1987 and now has a cumulative addition of only 50 ppm. This is not proportional to observations recorded in 1958 at the US Mauna Loa weather station and the South Pole which showed that atmospheric CO2 was 315.2 ppm; the world population then was 2.9 billion. The level of CO2 with no anthropogenic activity has been deduced from Ice core analyses in Greenland. It has been found that 18,000 years ago CO2 levels were 225 ppm; they rose to 271 ppm around 1300 A.D. when the continental glaciers started melting.

Changing patterns of climate, energy generation and consumption, deforestation and desertification are some anomalies that contribute to the rising trend of CO2. In other words development and harnessing of technology by the growing population and not just the increase in population, has contributed to increases in the level of CO2. This is aptly derived by Ehlrich’s equation:

I (impact) = P (population) x A (affluence) x T (technology).

For developing countries with a large weightage of population (P), low weightage for Technology (T) and Affluence (A), the value of Impact factor (I) will be (-).

I = (-)      Large (P).Low(T).Low(A)

Control of population will, in case of developing countries, have an average impact if the values of both (T) and (A) are reasonably high.

I = ≥       Large (P).High(T).Low(A)

The impact will be much more negative if the impact of social pollution, given by Corruption Perception Index (CPI) devised by Transparency International, is also taken into account.

I = (--)    Large (P).Low(T).Low(A).High(CPI)

Based on the above modifications of Ehrich’s equation, the following is expected to induce a practical, non-violent and humane approach to development and optimization of the ecological footprint:

Application of

a) appropriate technology (AT);

b) drastic reduction in consumerism;

c) restraining consumption and economic growth rate to match up with availability of resources; and

d) reducing social pollution to the extent that the CPI is much above 8.0 instead of 1.0 to 4.0 as generally observed for developing as well as developed countries,

Consumerism is contrary to the norms of conservationism and its slow down will not be acceptable to industrialized and industrializing countries with high (T) and (A), low population (P) and average (CPI in the 4-8 range). In the case of reduction in consumerism they will have to cut down their growth rate.

Cutting down the growth rate will imply application of appropriate technology (AT) as against high technology (HT), reduction in affluence (A) and saving the Earth’s resources from impoverishment and the Earth from over-exploitation. Conservation of resources and development within the limits of resource availability will therefore have to be adopted for the sake of sustainability.

The developed countries have however attained affluence and superiority in trade and weapons by applying technology; they are least inclined to retract because they would fall back into average category. They would rather prefer to allow migrants to settle and thus replace the retiring/ aging work force.

Climate is, however, influenced more by natural factors than just the anthropogenic factors the former include changes within the solar system, changes in Earth’s orbit, and intensity of Intergalactic Gravitational Forces (IGF):

Internal energy that maintains the mantle convection and drives the tectonic plates is only 0.019 percent of the energy that moves through the Earth. The energy being transferred from the interstellar space in particular the solar system is nevertheless high enough to induce: i) convection and compression in the interior of the Earth and ii) tides in the oceans in the hydrosphere. This paper has tried to illustrate that: Tectonic movement is astronomically related to changes in movement and orientation of the Earth, while intensification of intergalactic gravitational forces results in the onset of convection and compression waves in the interior of the Earth followed by earthquakes.

Ø  Changes occurring in the sun itself can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches Earth’s surface, and also alters the intensity of IGF. Alteration in the intensity of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun affects the pull and push forces comprising the IGF. It causes warming during periods of stronger solar intensity, and cooling during periods of weaker solar intensity. The Sun is known to follow a natural 11-year cycle of small variation in intensity; the effect on climate of the Earth is small but significant.

Ø  Changes in the shape of orbit as well as obliquity of the axis of the Earth affect the amount of electromagnetic radiation reaching its surface.

Changes in Earth’s orbit have had a big impact on climate over tens of thousands of years. In fact, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet’s orbit, appears to control the advance and retreat of ice sheets. These changes appear to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which Earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.

Answer

Dear Guo Zhang,

Choosing what crops or livestock to produce is an essential decision of any farm business. One critical factor in making that decision is the cost of producing the "enterprises" being considered. This is known as enterprise budgeting or cost of production budgeting. Enterprises are a single crop or livestock commodity that produces a marketable product. Cost of Production (COP) budgeting consists of estimating the costs associated with an enterprise and the expected revenue. This Factsheet outlines the process and use of COP budgeting for farm-level decision-making.

In economic cost analysis, the objectives of the analysis provide the standard against which costs and benefits are defined. Simply put, a cost is anything that redWhat Is A COP Budget

While the format of COP budgets can vary they typically include the following sections.

1 Revenue: the gross revenue from crop or livestock sales before any expenses have been deducted.

2 Direct Variable Costs: expenses for the production of a specific commodity. These change depending on the level of production (i.e., seed, fertilizer, pesticides and feed).

3 Indirect Variable Costs: expenses used in producing all commodities on the farm (i.e., fuel, labour and utilities). These also change depending on the level of production.

4 Fixed Costs: expenses that remain the same regardless of the level of production (i.e., property taxes, fire insurance and depreciation).

5 Net Profit (loss): revenue minus all variable and fixed costs.

Costs of Agricultural Projects

1\. Physical goods

2\. Labor

3\. Land

4\. Contingency allowances

5\. Taxes

6\. Debt service

7\. Sunk costs

8\. Tangible Benefits of Agricultural

9\. Increased production

10\. Quality improvement

11\. Change in time of sale

12\. Change in location of sale

13\. Changes in product form (grading and processing)

14\. Cost reduction through mechanization

15\. Reduced transport costs

16\. Losses avoided

17\. Other kinds of tangible benefits

18\. Secondary Costs and Benefits

19\. Intangible Costs and Benefits

uces an objective, and a benefit is anything that contributes to an objective.

Answer

Dear Georgios,

The  Fertilizer use can contributes to GHG emissions in the following  ways:

(a) CO2 emissions from the energy intensive production process

(b) CO2 emissions from the energy used in the transport of fertilizer from the production facility to farm-gate

(c) CO2 emissions from the energy use in machinery required for fertilizer application (this applies only if machinery is used for fertilizer spreading which is very common in large scale farming in industrialized countries)

nitrous oxide since this component is extraneous to the production process. The plausibility of nitrous oxide releases from nitrogen based fertilizers is a massive GHG concern. This is because of its higher global warming potential (GWP) than CO2.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils after application of N containing fertilizer is the other pathway.  Although I mentioned this last in the list, this is the most important contributor to GHG emissions.  Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) protocols provide an average N2O emission factor of 1.25 kg N2O-N/kg N applied.  However, this emission factor could range from 0.05 – 1.5 kg N2O-N/kg N applied, depending on the climatic and soil conditions as well as method and timing of N fertilizer application.

the CO2 emission factors for NPK fertilizer production, mixing and transport in your region.  For North America the average CO2 emission factors for NPK are as follows:

2.792 kg CO2 equivalents / kg N

0.738 kg CO2 equivalents / kg P2O5

0.352 kg CO2 equivalents / kg K2O

I am an intern from Yacht Carbon Offset (YCO2) and I am looking for the embodied energy and embodied carbon for the following material: steel, stainless steel, aluminium and glass.

These data will serve to determine the lifecycle and carbon footprint of yachts or charters. Our current database used is the Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE, 2011). However, it seems that it becomes to be outdated and it would be great to find a new set of data.

Thus, I would like to know if by any chance, you know a more recent database that could apply to the yacht industry.

Thank you in advance for your help,

Answer

Carbon footprint evolved as a part of the 'ecological footprint' concept which was devised by William Rees and Mathis Wackernagel. In this paper from jan 1996

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226184045\_Revisiting\_Carrying\_Capacity\_Area-Based\_Indicators\_of\_Sustainability](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226184045_Revisiting_Carrying_Capacity_Area-Based_Indicators_of_Sustainability)

William Rees described how carbon-assimilation is part of the ecological footprint but here he used the term 'energy footprint' and not carbon footprint.

I'm not sure who first used the term, but I do know that it wasn't until 2006 that it became more widespread. One of the earliest references to carbon footprint I am aware of is this patent filed in oct 2005 [https://www.google.com/patents/US20060089851](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fpatents%2FUS20060089851) but I don't think that's the first usage of the term. According to Google Trends the term was already used occasionally when Google started collecting query data in 2004: [https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%22carbon%20footprint%22](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Ftrends%2Fexplore%23q%3D%2522carbon%2520footprint%2522)

I strongly think and hope very large scale desalination of sea water to irrigate arid zone is the second way to fight against global warming and its consequences as rise in sea level and accelerated desertification of arid.

Of course, the first is the sustainable behavior; desalination might be performed and funded by ecological means.

In a previous discussion :

[https://www.researchgate.net/post/Would\_the\_desalination\_in\_an\_ecological\_way\_of\_ten\_thousand\_billion\_cubic\_meters\_of\_sea\_water\_have\_a\_significant\_effect\_of\_the\_rise\_of\_sea\_level/1](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Would_the_desalination_in_an_ecological_way_of_ten_thousand_billion_cubic_meters_of_sea_water_have_a_significant_effect_of_the_rise_of_sea_level/1)

Pr K. M.Towe said :"There is no way for "photosynthesis" to "pay" for it's subsequent LONG TERM microorganisms aerobic recycling". I must specify : recycling humans, animals and plants carbon. I wonder how is it possible reforestation would not have any significant effect on carbon footprint and over what time period photosynthesis is much greater than the aerobic respiration of microorganisms.

If respiration of microorganisms always prevailed over that of plants, a long time ago we would have no more oxygen. Do the rainforests have a negative balance sheet of oxygen/carbon?

At a rate of two dollars per cubic meter of desalinated water, what would be carbon foot print over several years of a cubic meters of desalted water in arid and sunny area? That is the question?

Energy efficiency is just one of the many criteria that could be used, as 'footprints' are being adapted to measure the impacts of buildings in terms of carbon emissions, water and energy consumption.

In other words, how distant we are from considering all the aspects related to the consumption of resources in the 'sustainability' equation of our building stock? Could this be delivered through a unified indicator?

Answer

I am afraid that I may not be able to contribute completely in this matter but I feel like I could add a suggestion or another way of thinking on the topic.

Something else to consider would be the relation to decay. Materials off gas and fall apart or they combine with the conditions of the area to speed up the process or to create a poison. Sometimes the materials actually used in the architecture, although great for long lasting built environments, are actually toxic to the people living on the located site.

I also feel that the "footprint" could be measured by usage. Was every part of the space utilized to the fullest? If the building changed functions, how has it coped with the new usage despite the original purpose? Was the "footprint" economical in design? Would it be worth it in the long run to upkeep a building because it works so well or is it necessary to upkeep it to modify? (I hope this made sense).

Answer

Intuitively, I shudder.  Lets compare the processes:

Extract plant matter from the ocean, in a manner that does not significantly alter the local ecosystem, using underwater equipment.  Treat it in some way to remove the salt (unless osmotic pressure is maintained by a very high sugar content, instead).  Ensure that the pollution that we release into the oceans does not accumulate in the animals that eat the vegetation, probably by an extraction process that removes just the wanted chemistry from the vegetation..  Dump the waste vegetation into a composting facility, to ensure that the remaining cellulose and hemi-cellulose doesn't degrade to methane. Mix the extracted chemistry with the animals' food stock, testing it to ensure there is the targeted balance of nutrients and sugars.  Dump the remains back into the ocean to become the next generation of plants.

OR

Let animals eat the vegetation that grows in places where we can't use efficient planting and harvesting techniques (eg, pasture land).

One of these things is simpler than the other, with a much lower embodied energy, waste products, and with far fewer unknowns.  I don't know how you would be able to predict the 'shadow' of this process, eg, identifying all of the aspects of the ecosystem that would be negatively affected by the process - maybe this is simpler than it appears. But I'm not seeing it.

Answer

it is a simple fact that some watersheds have less water available than others.  those with less water should be the subject of more active water management - at the watershed level at least.  This moves quickly beyond simply counting the litres used although this is a good start.

See also the ISO 14046 standard, which deals with water inventory and management. This standard is quite technical, so there is at least one working group investigating ways to interpret and use it: [http://wulca-waterlca.org/](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwulca-waterlca.org%2F)

Answer

The impact from the production of concrete is mainly driven by the production of clinker (used in cement). The impact from the production of clinker is driven by the energy source used. So if you can model those two factors on your LCI according to the local practices you can represent the local conditions. More details on production efficiency of the used plants can improve the accuarcy of your calculation

Question

2 answers

- 22 Oct 2015

Hello,

For an environmental-biotechnological application, I'm investigating the state of the art of hydrogen production by methane decomposition / "carbon black". I have invested some time to read in the literature, but it has been inconclusive so far.

I'd highly appreciate if somebody could help me answer some of the following questions or point me to relevant and up-to-date literature:

1. EROI: how much energy is gained per energy invested in an actual process and/or how much energy of the methane can be practically recovered as H2? My understanding is that the process has an upper bound of about 64%, since CH4 has about 890 kj/mol enthalphy of combustion whereas two H2 have 572 kg/mol. However, I'm uncertain for example, how much energy of the required heating can be reclaimed in heat exchangers or how much energy has to be invested for catalyst regeneration (if catalysts are worth the trouble?). How does energy efficiency compare to steam reforming or water electrolysis?
2. Assuming my process does not require a pure stream of hydrogen and can tolerate or even use residual methane to some extent: How are the ergonomics and economics of CH4 decomposition? How difficult is it to operate such a plant? To which value would you estimate the capital cost and average cost per H2 produced? How would that compare to water electrolysis?
3. While the "carbon black" process is said to operate in industries for a long time, reading in the literature it seems to me there are fundamental challenges (i.e. catalyst inactivation). Are there actually commercial plants producing hydrogen via CH4 composition and what are their setups? And if not, what are the prime reasons it is not done?

Thank you very much for your answers.

regards,

Ingvar

Answer

I agree with Deepak Kumar Ojha.

But there is an industrial process based on decomposition of  CH4 to carbon black.

The process is to produce carbon black (with a special characteristic) so the EROI of the process is based on the economical value of carbon black.

I suggest to you to read a good general bibliography (and old)  on the hydrogen production or even on ammonia production  : Ullman Encylopedy

Answer

I taught the concept as part of environmentally-related I was teaching by introducing  defining it first and then move on to a few case study I conducted myself (as I did a lot of projects on carbon reporting and accounting for companies/agencies). I would say in  teaching about carbon footprint, the essential matter is to emphasise on the importance of knowing the footprint or baseline for that matter for any actions to manage and reduce can be taken from there.

Answer

I think that exact number are difficult to get because thy depend on the scenario.

International Energy Agency in its World Energy Outlook 2014 suggests several scenarios for electricity production in 2020 in OECD Europe. The values are in Mtoe.

In 450 scenario there will be: coal 176, oil 11, gas 137, nuclear 224, hydro 51, bioenergy 68, other renewables 63.

In current policies scenarios there will be more coal (209) and gas (147).

You may find current country data in Eurostat but I do not know where to find forecast for those countries. I would use current composition and the trend suggested by IAE to figure out that.

Conducting environmental impact research on cleantech floating solar photovoltaic systems (FPV or FSPV) for sustainable agriculture at vineyards and wineries, in particular water savings in terms of water preservation and evaporation reduction due to installation of over water  floating solar systems on lakes, dams, irrigation ponds reservoirs, agricultural and mining ponds, hydroelectric reservoirs and canals.

Would really appreciate links to reports where evaporation rates had been monitored or measured, or forecasted with mathematical modelling or environmental monitoring models are used to model or predict water evaporation rates of floatovoltaics on irrigation ponds or rivers or water canals.

Formulas for calculating evaporation rates from weather station data for planned floatovoltaic installations would be most helpful, especially if related to water savings in hydropower hybrid floatovoltaic installations on irrigation dams lakes or reservoirs.

Answer

The addition of a surtax to traffic fuels is just one of many means for governments to tax  people. If the tax is sufficiently high it may lower the consumption of automotive fuels and hence maybe improve the quality of air in congested urban areas, and thus have a positive effect on general health conditions.

However, its biggest effect will be in impoverishing many citizens who rely on affordable fuel in their everyday life.  Regarding global climate this will have no or negligible affect, because an increase in emissions of carbon dioxide, will not have any appreciable effect on either regional nor global climate. CO2 is NOT the main climate driver - the SUN is!

Dear Sir,

You can use LCA approach..

Right from the production of PV Cell, Aluminum/ Steel Frames, Electrical eqiup./ Electronics used., and other accessories..

if you bring this electronics system to any factory gate then,

for fabrication of this in factory it required 173 watt for producing a Solar PV system of 1 watt capacity, which can produce this power in 34 days when it is installed....

now  for minor things of we calculate . GRR (Green Rate of Return) will be around 60-70 days in total..

means, Solar PV can produce more power or emit less in its life cycle.

The emissions will depend on a number of factors including the composition of the waste, climate, landfill conditions and methane capture. The IPCC ( [http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp%2F)) provides the methodology and also an Excel tool to calculate emissions, although this is more aimed at total national waste emissions.

For incineration, the main question is whether there is any energy recovery, in which case the emissions are attributed to the energy, rather than the waste.

Answer

Life cycle impact assessment of buildings with respect to carbon footprint is the scope or canvas that harnesses the production of carbon footprint from the extraction of that material from the ore to manufacturing, delivery (transportation), fabrication to use (if a labor uses a machines to fix or fit the product and uses energy that has been produced from fossil fuel, performance during  its useful life, demolition, disposal (return to disposal area including transportation) and any natural or artificial reaction that may cause a carbon footprint; all the activities will be included in the question asked.

This will require a carbon footprint flowchart to calculate the impact on each stage and of each and every product, activity and embodied carbon of the machines that have been used to construct that building.

Obviously, many theses can be written on each and many other aspects that I may have overlooked.

Answer

Theoretically the carbon footprint would indicate the ability of a country or region to live sustainably ad infinitum.

.

However the carbon footprint (or ecological footprint) is an index that alone says nothing, or worse is an index that while others celebrate because Haitians, Pakistanis or has a carbon footprint much smaller than the Americans and Danes. However Haitians and Pakistanis may wish to have a high carbon footprint.

.

I consider that the mere quantification of carbon footprint as sustainability index is a real nonsense, because it is an index that is strongly correlated with the GDR per capita than anything else.

Question

35 answers

- 29 Apr 2014

Cities play an important role in social and economic activities. Cities generally perform poorly in terms of environmental performance (compared to social and economic activities). One of the main reasons behind this poor environmental performance appears to be due to population pressure and its impacts on the environment. Currently, about 50% population live in cities which is projected to rise in the coming years (by 2050 it could 6 out of 10 people will live in cities). Most of world megacities (> 10 million people) are in developing countries (e.g. Guangzhou, Shanghai, Jakarta, Seoul, Delhi, Mexico, Karachi, Manila, Sao Paulo, Mumbai, Beijing, Moscow, Dhaka, Cairo, Kolkata, Buenos Aires, Bangkok, Istanbul, Lagos, Tehran, Rio de Janeiro, Shenzhen and Tanjin) and few are in developed countries (Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Osaka, London, Rhine-Ruhr, Paris). The dense population in cities generate huge volume of solid and soluble wastes, the demand for electricity, water and traffic in cities will cause significant carbon footprints and water footprints. What measures would be needed so that cities remain a healthy place to live on in terms of managing carbon pollution and water pollution in the future?

Answer

Dear Rogerio,

it is also my opinion, that the agriculture in industrial countries is not social and not sustainable , therefore I cited the tiny group of organic farmers who are often opposed and get difficulties.

The western lifestyle uses resources of more than one planet.

Moreover, cities perform badly in many repects.

Nearly half the world population are small farmers mainly in Asia and Africa. Education and health services for them are more difficult to establish, but not impossible and need not increase the low GHG emissions in these countries.

The Global Report (Agriculture at the Crossroads) critisizes inappropriate policy interventions, socioeconomic exclusion and the failure to address the real needs of poor people, recommending agro-ecological small-scalle farming, balancing beetwen economy and ecology - scaling up socially and environmentally sustainable practices.

Large cities are also more vulnerable, if the supply should be interrupted.

Their rapid growth is not well planned. Why not favor cities of more moderate extension ?

If cities are planned completely, they may perform perfectly for a while ecologically, but only for the period of time, where the planning conditions are not changed to much.

Thus, many aspects are important - also the balance between a sufficient size of the population and the impact on the environment.

Answer

Perhaps your inquiry needs to be re-framed? natural rubber is a substance at the cradle. it will enter many different "life cycles" in the industries which use it. so the task becomes almost impossible to execute. to start with natural rubber is to open up a life-web, rather than a cycle. Perhaps it would be good to start with a major manufactured use of natural rubber. If the biggest use is in tyres, perhaps that would be a useful case to examine.

Reading this discussion, I have the feeling that the question of Ahmed has not been answered yet. One of the easiest ways to calculate CO2 (equivalent) emissions of a building is to use the data in the excel tables which an be found at [www.ecocostsvalue.com](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecocostsvalue.com) tab data. The tables contain the kg CO2 euqivalent of materials from cradle to gate, applying LCIs from Ecoinvent and Idemat, calculated by Simapro. For the use phase data for electricity, oil and gas are given as well. the way how to make these "fast track LCA" calculations is explained at the same website

Answer

We have enough energy from the sun and hydro to satisfy our (and our future generation) energy demands. The reason we do not have that is because of very poor infrastructure and very bad energy management. We are at primordial stage as a collective entity. Nuclear physicist should never ever consider themselves energy experts or any other physicists specializing in particular energy technology say geothermal or solar. Energy experts are those who study energy in any (and all) forms that are available and use those with the minimum effort and footprint. Therefore I do not see nuclear technology as energy source to be needed when looking from practical point of view. Regarding your question of renaissance, nuclear technology definitely needs a breakthrough in innovation (not in mass production of reactors) and should be a fusion in form of He-3 = He-3 reaction. It leaves the lowest footprint in terms of radiation and modest amount of energy output when compared to other fusion reaction. Of course, academia must figure out how to make this fusion happen and make it practical and economical.

- 25 Apr 2013

Answer

You have to consider the full "well-to-wheel" energy path, starting at the raw fuel (typically fossil-based) and get to 1km traveled on the road. So for Petrol/Diesel also consider the roughly 25% of C02 from the manufacturing process before the vehicle C02 emissions. For electric consider the electric generation CO2 mix. Much nuclear (e.g. France) or much solar/wind (e.g. Spain) means low C02 (100g/kWh for France) but mostly goal/gas means very high CO2 (e.g. 1000g/kWh for South Africa). There are several studies done by industry but not many academically robust ones.

For Europe Battery Electrical Vehicles typically come out best by a good margin, even when compared to the latest high-efficiency petrol/diesel vehicles.

Answer

Similar to Maria I have tried to make small changes to my lifestyle to reduce the energy I use. I use the bicycle where possible for work. I have changed my energy supplier to one that uses much more renewable energy, and I am very aware of the energy I use in the house. I save energy where I can (lower wattage and energy efficient lightbulbs), only running applicances when they are full. I never use a tumble dryer as clothes dry naturally, I odn't understand why is there such a need in our society to have clothes dried instantly! My house has cavity wall insulation and full loft insualtion, so keeps the heat in well. In the winter I often use the wood cut down from my garden to heat the room (in my real fire), rather than using gas. I often only heat one room instead of the whole house when only I am in. I recycle everything I can including taking things from work home if they are not recyclable there. I collect water for the garden and very rarely use the hose. I save water in the home my having bricks in the toilet cisterns and special devices on the shower to reduce water use (and never have a bath). I also think it is important to buy less and use goods for longer, we need to go back to how life was 50+ years ago when clothes were sewn instead of thrown away, electrical items were fixed rather than put in the bin for landfill. My car is 19 years old and still works fine, I don't need a new car every two years. I get annoyed with insurance companies that are willing to write off a car so easily, what happens to this car afterwards, it just gets left to rot? I also use biodegradable detergents (and sometimes little balls in the washing meaning no need for detergent at all!). I never use the standby on the TV or other devices and only have lights on when I need them.I try to buy local and buy British, althuogh this is less easy when it comes to electrical goods. I only use the brand of toilet paper that plants 3 trees for every tree they use in making it. Having less children than the average means I'm not contributing to the growth in population, which possibly contributes to another slight reduction in resource use. If we all make some small changes, it has to help the future of our planet for the next generation!

Answer

You can do the same with the mass increase in the volume of the oceans as the

height of the oceans has increased by about 100 meters in the last 10,000 years, so the mass of the oceans has increased. Since water and Carbon Dioxide are products of combustion, both will increase in volume and mass as the rate of consumption

of all combustibles increases with time. It should plot as an exponentially increasing

curve as our abilities to extract and consume increase, and our population increases,

and the number of people with access to more advanced technologies increases.

Answer

Energy efficiency is crucial for the carbon footprint when using energy from non-renewable energy sources. Energy efficiency is not expected to lead to higher energy proces as the energy demand decreases. In contrary a (relative) decrease in energy prices could be expected due to the lesser demand.

Many energy efficiency measures are cost effective leading to lower life cycle energy costs. See e.g. Understanding Cost-Effectiveness of Energy Efficiency Programs ...
